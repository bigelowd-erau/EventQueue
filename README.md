# EventQueue (controls f and s)
<p>https://bigelowd-erau.github.io/EventQueue/</p>
<p>This is a crude implementation that is messy and gross.</p>
<p>I will be making an EventQueue factory that the eventbus passes the event to</p>
<p>The factory will then deceide which EventQueue to store the event in</p>
<p>Each EventQueue will handle the logic for triggering queued events</p>
